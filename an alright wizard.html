    <p>You are venturing to Avelon Central, where the evil of aelon started and spread. No one cheers you on as you leave your hometown due to the fact that you just got to this world, and started as a loner. All you have is your trusty sword and shield coupled with you leather armor, and that weird skirt like armor you have around your waist... Down the misty forest you venture, and out of shadows, a black slime from the evil army of Aelon came out to stop you.</p>
