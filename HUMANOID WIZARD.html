    <title>The warriors of the east</title>
    <body>
    <p>A lv3 monster it is..., although it is a higher level than you, you know you can still beat it. All for the honor of the warriors. You charged at it, and like bulls locking horns, your wands magic clashes with his blade. Unlike your previouse battle with the black slime, this time, there were more white sparks coming out of your wand, and red and black from blade. In your view, the battle was intense, and it felt as if it were never gonna end, but form a further distance, it looked like....childs play.even though the monster was overpowering you by a little, you were smarter, only due to the fact that monsters barely has any brains at all. Instead of continuing this losing clash, you kicked dust into its eyes, blinding it, then stabbed the monster and shot a beam of light into him, watching as  300 gold, 300 blue orbs, and 450green orbs spill out of the monsters stab wound. You leveled up to level 4, and now you have 3 skill points. The monster dissolves into black smoke, and your next opponent meets you... It was an ogre. It was lv 5, and you knew this somehow. After your previouse victory, and your new level, you know that you can beat the monster. You let out a scream of honor, and charged for the monster. The ogre swung it's axe at you, but you knew better than to try to counter it, so you ducked, and slashed its leg with magic. The monster could still stand, not only have you wounded it, but you have angered it, and because of that knowledge, you knew that another attack was coming. You blasted the ogres back repeatedly with magic. Again and again, the ogre tries to get back at you, but you were one step ahead. You landed the final blow on the ogre, and watched as it screamed at the sky, spewing out 500 gold,500 blue orbs, and 600 exp. You stood there in triumph, and without realizing it, the ogre fell on you instead of dissolving, and you passed out. You woke up, and found yourself lying down ona bed, and drinking sweet liquid, you didn't stop, because it made you feel better. It was an old lady who was feeding it to you. 3 Warriors came into the room and approached you. They said: "we are grateful for your contribution in battle against those....monsters, and we want to reward you with free upgrades on all your armory and weapons, and we would also like to show you to our barracks. That is all!" Get ready for more nerdy things....You use your 800 pieces of gold to purchase a magical staff, and belt. You then used your free upgrades to bring all your weaponary and armor to lv2, now instead of wood, it's stone. You used up all your mp on all your weapons as well, leaving the new weapons with 400 mp, and the old stuff with 300 mp. You went to the barracks, and used your 3 skill points to learn 3 special abilities! You learned piercing light, light wave, and light shield. You are now ready to inflict the art of bad assery on your enemies! You exited the village and entered a sandy canyon. You kept walking. You saw animal and human skeletons everywhere. You dont like the sight of it, and you keep walking. You then saw an eerie glow. Sand shifted from the glow so that you can see it better. It was yellowish orb of light, and within it, you saw something abnormal...there was darkness lurking in it. You knew what was going to happen, you ran at the orb quickly and tried to destroy it, but a skeletal wall slammed into your face, and the thing that you feared that was gonna happen, was happening. The skeletons that you saw formed into one. It was lv 10 skel monster that was slightly corrupted with the darkness that Aelon has brought forth! And somehow...you knew that. A large skeleton fist flew at you...</p>
