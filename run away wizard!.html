    <title>The warriors of the east</title>
    <body>
    <p>You ran down the foresty valley, not looking back, nor up. The enemies are still too high up within your reach, but still close enough to shoot arrows at you. The orges were lagging behind due to their bulkiness, the humanoid monsters were at your sides, and the humanoid monsters on hounds, were ahead of you, firing arrows at you. You merely escape from the severse injuries that you may recieve form the arrows, but of course, you were hit by some, and your hp is down from MAX, to HIGH, see the difference? It's not at it's maximum anymore, it's just high now.... Anyways, eager to survive and become an alright hero, you fight through your physical and cardio pain, and you keep running. Slowly, the cliffs at your side starts to go down towards your level, and just when the hounds and humanoid monsters where descending towards you, you saw a gate, and Warriors came out of the shadows, and started beating down the enemy raid. You ran behind the warriors, and you were safe. In your heart, a spirit was urging you to help the warriors defend their home, but due to cowardice, you also had the urge to just flee from the battle, and hide in the warriors village. Which voice will you listen to?</p>
