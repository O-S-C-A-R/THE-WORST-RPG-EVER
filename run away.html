    <title>YOU RAN</title>
    <body>
    <p>Through the ENTIRE adventure, you've been running away from monsters and finally, you reached Aelon, you know, the big boss of the game. You were gonna fight him, but Aelon just laughed. "You want to fight me?? You mortal IMBECILE. I have seen you made your way here, and countless times, you ran, and missed all the rewards and experience you get from fighting. You are weak, and you are nothing but an INSECT to me." Aelon raises his palm and faces it towards you. A black and red energy glowed, and got bigger and bigger, aaannnndddd......you're dead. </p>
