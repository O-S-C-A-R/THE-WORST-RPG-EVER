    <p>The black slime rushed at you, just as it got within inches from hurting you, you let out your wan, and blasted it. It exploded into 150 blue orbs(exp), 150 green orbs(what IS that?), a spell book, and 100 pieces of gold. How a small piece of slime can have so many things coming out of it, I dont know. Youre level 2 now, meaning, you have a skill point! Your health is higher, your attack is higher, and now... you can fight higher level things!(this game is so nerdy....)You kept the 100 gold and the spell book, not knowing what to do with them. You continue to venture down the forest, and you found what looked like a hut. You entered it without permission.(you probably don't wanna do that because it's rude, but too bad, youll have to play along with my game) You see a hooded figure sitting on crossed legs in the middle of white fiery ring. You were calmed by the aura of the white, and you do not have the mood to leave or interfere, for it may disrupt the peace that you are given in this quiet hut. In the midst of your peace, you hear a frailed voice coming from the hooded figure. And it says..."WELCOME TO MAGICAL STORE! Here, you can upgrade your magic, and your special abilities! You came to the right place young man! The higher your weapons magic points is, the more extra damage is inflicted on your enemies when you strike them! Now, would you like to upgrade your weapons with magic points?"</p>
