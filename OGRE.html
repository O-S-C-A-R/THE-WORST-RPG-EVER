    <title>OGRE</title>
    <body>
    <p>As you charged against the ogre, the other two baddies were taken down by warriors. You bored your glory filled eyes into the ogres and charged against it. You let out a battle scream as you charge. But the ogre's height towers over yours, making you look puny. It raised it's axe and swung it at you, and....you do NOT want to know what happened to you.</p>
