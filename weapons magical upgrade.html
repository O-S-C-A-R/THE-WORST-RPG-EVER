    <p>Great! your sword, helmet, breastplate, gauntlets, and skirts magic is stronger now! You continue your journey to the center of Avelon through the forest. You were in the middle of a valley, and at your sides, were tall cliffs. You then hear rush of wind, whistling your ear, and the next thing you heard was a thump, and next to you, was an arrow stuck in a tree trunk, just inches away form where you're standing. You looked up at the cliffs, and saw an army of orges, humanoid monsters, and humanoid monsters on dark colored hounds.</p>
