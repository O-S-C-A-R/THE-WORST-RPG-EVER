    As the great evil of aelon reigns the lands of avelon, You sit at home sipping coffee, after a whole long minute of choosing your class. I mean, you could just sit there and not do anything like a sissy, but, there is a fire in your heart. Your home may be in Dante, a minor city in the world of avelon, far far away from where the threat is spreading, but if you come out and venture to the dangers of the evil of aelon and stop it, you....will....be....an alright hero. So make your choice.
